2player_tic_tac_toe
===================


Welcome! This is my unbeatable 2 person tic tac toe. This was built in stages. 

I used TDD to build a 2player tic tac toe. 

From there, I created the logic for the computer to make moves in relation to the players input.

To run it, please download this repository and in the command line run:

~> ruby driver_code.rb
